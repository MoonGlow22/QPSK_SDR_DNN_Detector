Python code for simulating the experiment process

data_creator.py creates a random bit sequence, QPSK modulate it, add 19dB awgn, demodulate and save it in appropriate format. 

DNN_QPSK.py trains the model.

prediction_and_evaluation.py makes predictions both with DNN and Conventional Method (Constellation Decoder) and compares them.
